		As you work on a project, you will eventually need to manage files or folders, i.e. delete, copy, rename, or move them.
		TortoiseGit provides support for such operations.
		They are available from the context menu of versioned files (and folders) and are described in more detail in the following subsections.
	</p><div class="important" title="Git only tracks content" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Git only tracks content</h3><p>
			Unlike Subversion and other version control systems, Git does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> track file names.
			Git only tracks the contents of files and, therefore, it is not necessary to explicitly record copies, renames or moves.
			So there is generally no need to use Git's rename or remove functionality or even to "repair renames" as in Subversion.
			Renames and copies are automatically detected when you view the log.
			Nevertheless, adding (cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-add.html" title="Adding New Files">the section called “Adding New Files”</a>) and removing files from version control need to be recorded.
		</p></div><div class="important" title="Cannot copy between repositories" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Cannot copy between repositories</h3><p>
			Whilst you can copy and files and folders <span class="emphasis"><em>within</em></span>
			a repository, you <span class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> copy or move from one
			repository to another while preserving history using Git or TortoiseGit.
			Not even if the repositories live on the same server. All you can
			do is copy the content in its current state and add it as new
			content to the second repository.
		</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Deleting files and folders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tgit-dug-delete-copy-move-delete"></a>Deleting files and folders</h3></div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id712462"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id712457"></a><p>
			Use
			<span class="guimenu">TortoiseGit</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Delete</span>
			to remove files or folders from Git.
		</p><p>
			When you use
			<span class="guimenu">TortoiseGit</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Delete</span>
			on a file, it is removed from your working tree immediately as well
			as being marked for deletion in the repository on the next commit
			(i.e., the file is removed from the Git index). When you perform this action on a folder,
			all files/folders will be removed recursively.

			Up until you commit the change, you can get the file back using
			<span class="guimenu">TortoiseGit</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Revert</span>
			on the parent folder or use the commit (cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-commit.html" title="Committing Your Changes To The Repository">the section called “Committing Your Changes To The Repository”</a>) or status (cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-wcstatus.html" title="Getting Status Information">the section called “Getting Status Information”</a>) dialogs.
		</p><p>
			If you want to delete an item from version control, but keep it
			locally as an unversioned file/folder, use
			<span class="guimenu">Extended Context Menu</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Delete (keep local)</span>.
			There also is a special command for deleting an item and adding it to the ignore list (<span class="guimenu">Extended Context Menu</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Delete and add to ignore list</span>, cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-ignore.html" title="Ignoring Files And Directories">the section called “Ignoring Files And Directories”</a>).
			You may have to hold the <span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span> key while right clicking on
			the item in the explorer list pane (right pane) in order to see these options
			in the extended context menu.
		</p><p>
			If a file is deleted via the explorer instead of using TortoiseGit's context menu,
			the commit dialog (cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-commit.html" title="Committing Your Changes To The Repository">the section called “Committing Your Changes To The Repository”</a>) and status (cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-wcstatus.html" title="Getting Status Information">the section called “Getting Status Information”</a>) dialogs
			will show the file as <span class="emphasis"><em>missing</em></span>.
			Missing files are also automatically marked as deleted on commit when they are selected,
			but explicitly deleting a version-controlled file using
			<span class="guimenu">TortoiseGit</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Delete</span>
			may make your intention on commit more clear while your are preparing the commit.

				If you have deleted a file or a folder and already committed
				that delete operation to the repository, then a normal
				<span class="guimenu">TortoiseGit</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Revert</span>
				can't bring it back anymore. But the file or folder is not
				lost at all. If you know the revision the file or folder got
				deleted (if you don't, use the log dialog to find out) open
				the repository browser and switch to that revision. Then select
				the file or folder you deleted, right-click and select
				<span class="guimenu">Context Menu</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Revert to this revision</span>.
				Refer to <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-repobrowser.html" title="The Repository Browser">the section called “The Repository Browser”</a> and <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-showlog.html" title="Log Dialog">the section called “Log Dialog”</a> to find out more.

			It often happens that you already have the files you need in another folder
			in your repository. As Git only tracks content, simply copy the items across your working tree and 
			mark them as added or select them while committing (cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-add.html" title="Adding New Files">the section called “Adding New Files”</a>).
		</p><p>
			In order to get older versions of a file you can use the repository browser or the log dialog to locate content you want,
			and copy (or drag and drop) it into your working tree directly from the repository.
			Refer to <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-repobrowser.html" title="The Repository Browser">the section called “The Repository Browser”</a> and <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-showlog.html" title="Log Dialog">the section called “Log Dialog”</a> to find out more.

			If you want to do a simple in-place rename of a file or
			folder, use
			<span class="guimenu">Context Menu</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Rename...</span>
			Enter the new name for the item and you're done.
			You can move an item around in the whole working tree, i.e.,
			the name may start with <code class="filename">..\</code> to move a file upwards in the folder structure.
			Use the <span class="guibutton">...</span> to open a file chooser dialog which automatically generates the correct destination name.
		</p><p>
			The easiest way to move files and folders from within a working tree is
			to use the right-drag menu:
			</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
						Select the files or directories you want to move
					</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
						<span class="action">right-drag</span> them to the
						new location inside the working tree
					</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
						release the right mouse button
					</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
						in the popup menu select
						<span class="guimenu">Context Menu</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Git Move versioned files here</span>
					</p></li></ol></div><p>
			</p><div class="figure"><a name="tgit-dug-rename-right-drag-dia-1"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 2.48. Right drag menu for a directory under version control</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/RightDragMenu.png" alt="Right drag menu for a directory under version control"></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
		</p><p>
			Since Git only tracks content and not filenames, you could also simply move/rename files in Explorer.
			But then you have to mark the old file as deleted, and mark the new file as added separately later
			(at the latest during commit).

				Moving Submodules (<a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-submodule(1)" title="git-submodule(1)">the section called “git-submodule(1)”</a>)
				using TortoiseGit's <span class="guilabel">Move</span> and <span class="guilabel">Rename</span> commands
				should work. There are, however, notes for the used <a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-rm(1)" title="git-rm(1)">the section called “git-rm(1)”</a> command
				(cf. <a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-rm(1)__submodules" title="SUBMODULES">the section called “SUBMODULES”</a>).

			Making case-only changes to a filename needs special attention,
			because Windows does not honor the filename casing by default.
			Therefore just renaming a file using the rename command of the Explorer is likely not to work.
			It is important to rename it using Git in order to update the index to make it use the new filename.
			Use the <span class="guimenuitem">Rename...</span> command in the TortoiseGit submenu.
		</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Dealing with filename case conflicts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tgit-dug-delete-copy-move-rename-case-conflict"></a>Dealing with filename case conflicts</h3></div></div></div><p>
			If the repository already contains two files with the same name
			but differing only in case (e.g. <code class="filename">TEST.TXT</code>
			and <code class="filename">test.txt</code>), you
			will not be able to commit, and only one of them can be checkout
			on a Windows client. Whilst Git (in general) supports case-sensitive
			filenames, Windows does not.
		</p><p>
			This sometimes happens
			when files are committed from a system with a case-sensitive
			file system, like Linux, or when the setting <code class="literal">core.ignorecase</code> is set to false (cf. <a class="xref" href="git-command.html#git-config(1)" title="git-config(1)">the section called “git-config(1)”</a>).
		</p><p>
			In that case, you have to decide which one of them you want to
			keep and delete the other(s) from the repository (or rename the other(s)).
			Easiest way is to do that on a case-sensitive file system, followed by committing and pushing the changes.
			Doing it on Windows requires several steps (and two commits):

						(All the checked items are of <code class="literal">Deleted</code> status.)

						Uncheck only one item you want to keep.
					</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
						Commit the changes.
					</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
						Revert deletion of the wanted file in order to get it back. If you want to keep both or more files which had the "same" name, but with a different new name, do this for all files in question and rename them before proceeding with the next file.

			Usually you set your ignore list such that all generated files are ignored
			in Git. But what if you want to clear all those ignored items to produce
			a clean build? Usually you would set that in your makefile, but if you are
			debugging the makefile, or changing the build system it is useful to have a way
			of clearing the decks.
		</p><p>
			TortoiseGit provides just such an option using
			<span class="guimenu">Extended Context Menu</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Clean up...</span>.
			You may have to hold the <span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span> while right clicking on a folder
			in the explorer list pane (right pane) in order to see this in the
			context menu.
			This will show a dialog which lists all possible clean up options (cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-cleanup.html" title="Cleanup">the section called “Cleanup”</a>).
