		For every change you make and commit, you should provide
		a log message for that change. That way you can later find out
		what changes you made and why, and you have a detailed log for
		your development process.

		The Log Dialog retrieves all those log messages and shows them

		The display is divided into 3 panes.

			If a revision modified a file or directory, the
			<span class="emphasis"><em>modified</em></span> icon is shown in the first column.

			The top pane has a <span class="guilabel">Graph</span> column with a line showing
			the commits, merges and branches. There are two types of shapes.
		</p><p>
			The circles indicate normal commits w/o any branching.
		</p><p>
			The squares indicate merges and branchings. In the first case these are merge commits
			(i.e., a commit with more than one parent) and in the latter case these are also normal commits.
			A square was chosen here to indicate that a branch goes off.
		</p><p>
			The colors of the lines (and of the shapes) are there to make the graph better readable (i.e., to see to which branch they belong).
			The colors are configurable (cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-settings.html#tgit-dug-settings-colours3" title="TortoiseGit color Settings 3">the section called “TortoiseGit color Settings 3”</a>).

			The top pane also has a <span class="guilabel">message</span> column.
			In this column the subjects of the commits are shown.
			Commits which have an associated reference are decorated with a label.
		</p><p>
			Tags are by default displayed as yellow rectangles. In Git there are two tag types: normal tags and annotated tags. The annotated ones have an apex at the right side.
		</p><p>
			Normally branches are displayed as normal rectangles. The active branch is displayed as a dark red rectangle (by default), the green ones are local branches and the peach ones are remote branches.
		</p><p>
			The boxes with rounded corners for local branches indicate that it has an associated remote tracking. The boxes with rounded corners for remote tracking branches are used to indicate which of (possible several remote branches) is the corresponding remote tracking branch (e.g., master and origin/master).
		</p><p>
			The stash has a dark gray rectangle.
		</p><p>
			There are also rectangles to indicate the bad versions (light red) on bisecting, blue for known good and gray for skip.
		</p><p>
			Depending on what branch/tag label you open the context menu, it is optimized for that ref it was opened on (e.g., a local branch offers directly to switch to it and to push it whereas a remote branch has no push option).

			The colors are configurable (cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-settings.html#tgit-dug-settings-colours2" title="TortoiseGit color Settings 2">the section called “TortoiseGit color Settings 2”</a>). Also, the labels can be configured to be a the right side of the commit message or the displayed text to contain the whole of the commit message (cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-settings.html#tgit-dug-settings-dialogs" title="TortoiseGit Dialog Settings">the section called “TortoiseGit Dialog Settings”</a>).

			If you want to restrict the log messages to show only those
			you are interested in rather than scrolling through a list
			of hundreds, you can use the filter controls at the top of
			the Log Dialog.
		</p><p>
			The first element is the branch/revision filter.
			Clicking on it opens the Reference Browser (see <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-browse-ref.html" title="Browse All Refs">the section called “Browse All Refs”</a>).
			There you can select single or multiple references. If you select exactly two references,
			you can choose how to combine them (showing especially both A and B "A B"; showing
			differences "A...B" or all commits between A and B "A..B").
			This filter element also contains a special context menu. Here shortcuts for "HEAD",
			"FETCH_HEAD", "All" and "All local branches" are available. Also, the last manual selected
			filters are included there.
		</p><p>
			The start and end date controls allow you
			to restrict the output to a known date range. The search
			box allows you to show only messages which contain a
			particular phrase. A default limitation for <span class="guilabel">From</span> or the number of log entries displayed can be configured in the settings dialog on the <span class="guilabel">Dialogs 1</span> page (cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-settings.html#tgit-dug-settings-dialogs" title="TortoiseGit Dialog Settings">the section called “TortoiseGit Dialog Settings”</a>). When a default limitation is active, the <span class="guilabel">From</span> has a blueish background. By opening the context menu on the date picker, you can configure the default limit or disable the default limit for the current dialogue.
		</p><p>
			Click on the search icon (the magnifier glass) to select which information you want
			to search in, to choose <span class="emphasis"><em>regex</em></span> mode, and to toggle case sensitivity.
			Deselecting "Paths" can significantly speed up the filter.

			</p><div class="figure"><a name="tgit-dug-showlog-filter-dia-1"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 2.33. Option Menu for the Log Filter</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/LogFilterOptions.png" alt="Option Menu for the Log Filter"></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">

			Normally you will only need a simple sub-string search, but if you
			need to more flexible search terms, you can use regular expressions.
			If you hover the mouse over the box, a tooltip will give hints
			on how to use the regex functions.
			To invert the results for the entire search expression, start the string with an exclamation mark ('!').
			You can also find online documentation and a tutorial at
			<a class="ulink" href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/" target="_blank">
				<em class="citetitle">https://www.regular-expressions.info/</em>
			</a>.
			The filter works by checking whether your filter string matches
			the log entries, and then only those entries which <span class="emphasis"><em>match</em></span>
			the filter string are shown.
		</p><p>
			Simple sub-string search works in a manner similar to a search engine.
			Strings to search for are separated by spaces, and all strings must
			match. You can use a leading <code class="literal">-</code> to specify that a
			particular sub-string is not found (invert matching for that term),
			and you can use <code class="literal">!</code> at the start of the expression
			to invert matching for the entire expression.
			You can use a leading <code class="literal">+</code> to specify that a sub-string
			should be included, even if previously excluded with a <code class="literal">-</code>.
			Note that the order of inclusion/exclusion is significant here.
			You can use quotation marks to surround a string which must contain spaces,
			and if you want to search for a literal quotation mark you can use two
			quotation marks together as a self-escaping sequence.
			Note that the backslash character is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> used as
			an escape character and has no special significance in simple sub-string
			searches. Examples will make this easier:
			</p><pre class="screen">
Alice Bob -Eve
			</pre><p>
			searches for strings containing both Alice and Bob but not Eve
			</p><pre class="screen">
Alice -Bob +Eve
			</pre><p>
			searches for strings containing both Alice but not Bob, or strings
			which contain Eve.
			</p><pre class="screen">
-Case +SpecialCase
			</pre><p>
			searches for strings which do not contain Case, but still include
			strings which contain SpecialCase.
			</p><pre class="screen">
!Alice Bob
			</pre><p>
			searches for strings which do not contain both Alice and Bob
			</p><pre class="screen">
!-Alice -Bob
			</pre><p>
			do you remember De Morgan's theorem? NOT(NOT Alice AND NOT Bob)
			reduces to (Alice OR Bob).
			</p><pre class="screen">
"Alice and Bob"
			</pre><p>
			searches for the literal expression <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Alice and Bob</span>”</span>
			</p><pre class="screen">
""
			</pre><p>
			searches for a double-quote anywhere in the text
			</p><pre class="screen">
"Alice says ""hi"" to Bob"
			</pre><p>
			searches for the literal expression <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Alice says "hi" to Bob</span>”</span>.
		</p><p>
			You can also filter the path names in the bottom pane using the
			<span class="guimenu">View</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Hide unrelated changed paths</span>
			Related paths are those which contain the path used to display
			the log. If you fetch the log for a folder, that means anything

			You can use the drop-down control on the upper right to select a navigation type
			(e.g. Author Email, Parent 1, Selection history),
			then use the <span class="guibutton">Up</span>
			and <span class="guibutton">Down</span> green buttons
			to navigate through the commits which match the navigation type
			relative to the current selected one.
		</p><p>
			Alternatively to the <span class="guibutton">Up</span>
			and <span class="guibutton">Down</span> green buttons,
			hotkeys <span class="keycap"><strong>ALT</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>UP</strong></span>
			and <span class="keycap"><strong>ALT</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>DOWN</strong></span>
			are also available.
		</p><p>
			Regarding the navigation type "Selection History",
			TortoiseGit memorizes the history of selected commits,
			so that you can navigate through those commits
			you selected in the past easily.
			You can also navigate them by pressing
			<span class="keycap"><strong>ALT</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>LEFT</strong></span>,
			<span class="keycap"><strong>ALT</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>RIGHT</strong></span>,
			<span class="keycap"><strong>Browse Back</strong></span>,
			and <span class="keycap"><strong>Browse Forward</strong></span>.
			<span class="keycap"><strong>Back</strong></span> and <span class="keycap"><strong>Forward</strong></span> buttons
			on mouse are also available.
		</p><p>
			If you also press <span class="keycap"><strong>SHIFT</strong></span>
			you can navigate through the selection history
			without selecting the last commits
			(i.e., just scrolling to and highlighting them).
			This helps you to navigate through commits
			and then select the commit(s) you really want to select
			(e.g. you can compare the current selected commit
			with the one you selected before).
		</p><p>
			If you want to jump to a commit with a particular hash, you may
			do so by pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl+V</strong></span> or <span class="keycap"><strong>Shift+Insert</strong></span>
			(into any log dialog element other than the search box) to paste the hash
			from the clipboard. If it has the form of a valid commit hash, the log
			dialog will attempt to jump to it.

			The <span class="guibutton">Statistics</span> button brings up a box
			showing some interesting information about the revisions
			shown in the Log dialog. This shows how many authors have
			been at work, how many commits they have made, progress
			by week, and much more. Now you can see at a glance who
			has been working hardest and who is slacking ;-)

				Where there are a few major authors and many minor contributors,

			</p><p>
				When there are several authors, you will get many lines on the
				graph. There are two views available here: <span class="emphasis"><em>normal</em></span>,
				where each author's activity is relative to the base line, and
				<span class="emphasis"><em>stacked</em></span>, where each author's activity is
				relative to the line underneath.
				The latter option avoids the lines crossing over, which can make
				the graph easier to read, but less easy to see one author's output.

			By default the analysis is case-sensitive, so users
			<code class="literal">PeterEgan</code> and <code class="literal">PeteRegan</code>
			are treated as different authors. However, in many cases user names
			are not case-sensitive, and are sometimes entered inconsistently,
			so you may want <code class="literal">DavidMorgan</code> and
			<code class="literal">davidmorgan</code> to be treated as the same person.
			Use the <span class="guilabel">Authors case insensitive</span> checkbox
			to control how this is handled.
		</p><p>
			The statistics dialog also honors the <code class="filename">.mailmap</code> file
			(see <a class="xref" href="git-misc.html#gitmailmap(5)" title="gitmailmap(5)">the section called “gitmailmap(5)”</a>).
		</p><p>
			Note that the statistics cover the same period as the
			Log dialog. If that is only displaying one revision
			then the statistics will not tell you very much.
