			Now that you have checked out a working tree
			you can see your files in the windows explorer with
			changed icons. This is one of the reasons why TortoiseGit is so
			popular. TortoiseGit adds a so called overlay icon to each
			file icon which overlaps the original file icon. Depending on
			the Git status of the file the overlay icon is different.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/InGitIcon.png"></div><p>
			A fresh checked out working tree has a green checkmark as overlay.
			That means the Git status is <span class="emphasis"><em>normal</em></span>.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/ModifiedIcon.png"></div><p>
			As soon as you start editing a file,
			the status changes to <span class="emphasis"><em>modified</em></span>
			and the icon overlay then changes to a red exclamation
			mark. That way you can easily see which files were changed
			since you last updated your working tree and need to be committed.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/ConflictIcon.png"></div><p>
			If during an update a <span class="emphasis"><em>conflict</em></span> occurs then
			the icon changes to a yellow exclamation mark.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/ReadOnlyIcon.png"></div><p>
			This tells you that this file is marked as "assume-valid".
			This overlay is optional.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/LockedIcon.png"></div><p>
			This tells you that this file is marked as "skip-worktree".
			This overlay is optional.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/DeletedIcon.png"></div><p>
			This icon shows you that some files or folders inside the current folder
			have been scheduled to be <span class="emphasis"><em>deleted</em></span> from version control.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/AddedIcon.png"></div><p>
			The plus sign tells you that a file has been scheduled to be
			<span class="emphasis"><em>added</em></span> to version control.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/IgnoredIcon.png"></div><p>
			The bar sign tells you that a file or folder is
			<span class="emphasis"><em>ignored</em></span> for version control purposes.
			This overlay is optional.
		</p><p>
			</p><div><img src="images/UnversionedIcon.png"></div><p>
			This icon shows files and folders which are not under version control,
			but have not been ignored.
			This overlay is optional.
		</p><p>
			In fact, you may find that not all of these icons are used on your system.
			This is because the number of overlays allowed by Windows is very limited
			and if you are also using an old version of TortoiseCVS or tools with overlay handlers such as SkyDrive, DropBox or GoogleDrive, then there are
			not enough overlay slots available.
			TortoiseGit tries to be a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Good Citizen (TM)</span>”</span>
			and limits its use of overlays to give other apps a chance too.
		</p><p>
			If you have problems with overlays, please see the online
			<a class="ulink" href="https://tortoisegit.org/support/faq/#ovlnotshowing" target="_blank"><em class="citetitle">FAQ</em></a>.

			It's often very useful to know which files you have

			This is the default color scheme, but you can customise those colors
			using the settings dialog.
			Read <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-settings.html#tgit-dug-settings-colours" title="TortoiseGit color Settings">the section called “TortoiseGit color Settings”</a> for more information.
		</p><p>
			From the context menu of the dialog you can show a diff of the
			changes. Check the local changes <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> made using
			<span class="guimenu">Context Menu</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Compare with Base</span>.
			Check the changes in the repository made by others using
			<span class="guimenu">Context Menu</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Show Differences as Unified Diff</span>.
		</p><p>
			You can also revert changes in individual files. If you have deleted
			a file accidentally, it will show up as <span class="emphasis"><em>Missing</em></span>
			and you can use <span class="emphasis"><em>Revert</em></span> to recover it.
		</p><p>
			Unversioned and ignored files can be sent to the recycle bin from here using
			<span class="guimenu">Context Menu</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Delete</span>.
			If you want to delete files permanently (bypassing the recycle bin) hold
			the <span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span> key while clicking on <span class="guilabel">Delete</span>.
		</p><p>
			If you want to examine a file in detail, you can drag it from here
			into another application such as a text editor or IDE.
		</p><p>
			The columns are customizable. If you
			<span class="action">right click</span> on any column header you will see a
			context menu allowing you to select which columns are displayed.
			You can also change column width by using the drag handle which
			appears when you move the mouse over a column boundary. These
			customizations are preserved, so you will see the same headings
			next time.
		</p><p>
			If you are working on several unrelated tasks at once, you can also
			group files together into changelists.
			Read <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-commit.html#tgit-dug-commit-changelists" title="Change Lists">the section called “Change Lists”</a> for more information.
		</p><p>
			At the bottom of the dialog you have several options to select which entries to show (such as ignored or untracked/unversioned files).
			It is also possible to view all files which were marked as "Assume valid" or "Skip worktree" here (using <span class="guilabel">Show ignore local changes flagged files</span>).
			Resetting those flags (it's also possible to edit this flag using file properties in explorer on the <span class="guilabel">Git</span> tab).

			<span class="guilabel">Save unified diff</span>: Generates an unified patch containing the uncommitted changes and opens it with the configured diff viewer. If you want to pass your changes to other people, consider <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-patch.html" title="Creating and Applying Patches and Pull Requests">the section called “Creating and Applying Patches and Pull Requests”</a>.
		</p><p>
			<span class="guilabel">Stash</span>: Is a drop-down menu for quick access to Git stash (cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-stash.html" title="Stash Changes">the section called “Stash Changes”</a>). This feature allows you to put aside uncommitted changes in order to work on an unrelated issue and get the changes back afterwards easily.
		</p><p>
			<span class="guilabel">Commit</span>: Opens the commit dialog (cf. <a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-commit.html" title="Committing Your Changes To The Repository">the section called “Committing Your Changes To The Repository”</a>) with the very same folder/files the current dialog was opened on. If you want to pre-populate the commit dialog with only a subset of files, select the files and choose <span class="guimenuitem">Commit...</span> in the context menu.

			Often you want to look inside your files, to have a look at what
			you've changed. You can accomplish this by selecting a file which
			has changed, and selecting <span class="guimenuitem">Diff</span> from
			TortoiseGit's context menu. This starts the external
			diff-viewer, which will then compare the current file with the
			pristine copy (<code class="literal">BASE</code> revision), which was stored
			after the last checkout or update.

				Even when not inside a working tree or when you have multiple

			</p><p>
				Select the two files you want to compare in explorer
				(e.g. using <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span> and the mouse) and
				choose <span class="guimenuitem">Diff</span> from TortoiseGit's
				context menu. The file clicked last (the one with the focus,
				i.e. the dotted rectangle) will be regarded as the later
				one.
