		Sometimes you need to know not only what lines have changed, but also
		who exactly changed specific lines in a file. That's when the
		<span class="guimenu">TortoiseGit</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Blame...</span>
		command, sometimes also referred to as <em class="firstterm">annotate</em>
		command comes in handy.
	</p><p>
		This command lists, for every line in a file, the author and the revision
		the line was changed.

			By default the blame file is viewed using <em class="firstterm">TortoiseGitBlame</em>,
			which highlights the different revisions to make it easier to read.

			TortoiseGitBlame, which is included with TortoiseGit.
			When you hover the mouse over a line in the blame info
			column, all lines with the same revision are shown with a darker
			background. Lines from other revisions which were changed by the same author
			are shown with a light background.
			The coloring may not work as clearly if you have your display set to
			256 color mode.
		</p><p>
			If you <span class="action">left click</span>
			on a line (on the blame info column on the left), all lines with the same revision are highlighted, and lines from
			other revisions by the same author are highlighted in a lighter color.
			This highlighting is sticky, allowing you to move the mouse without losing
			the highlights. Click on that revision again to turn off highlighting.
		</p><p>
			The revision comments (log message) are shown in a hint box whenever
			the mouse hovers over the blame info column. If you want to copy the
			log message for that revision, use the context menu which appears when
			you right click on the blame info column.
		</p><p>
			If you need a better visual indicator of where the oldest and newest
			changes are, select
			<span class="guimenu">View</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Colorize by age, continuous</span>.
			Then the background color intensity of the lines is related to its age.
			This will use a color gradient to show newer lines in yellow and older lines
			in white. The default coloring is quite light, but you can change it using the TortoiseGitBlame settings.
		</p><p>
			Please also check out the <span class="guimenuitem">View</span> menu. There you can toggle the <span class="guimenuitem">Ignore whitespace</span> and also toggle the detection of moved/copied lines from other files and <span class="guimenuitem">Follow renames</span>.
		</p><p>
			You can search within the Blame report using
			<span class="guimenu">Edit</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Find...</span>.
			This allows you to search for revision numbers, authors and the content of
			the file itself. Log messages are not included in the search - you should
			use the Log Dialog to search those.
		</p><p>
			You can also jump to a specific line number using
			<span class="guimenu">Edit</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Go To Line...</span>.
		</p><p>
			When the mouse is over the blame info columns, a context menu is
			available which helps with comparing revisions and examining history,
			using the commit of the line under the mouse as a reference.
			<span class="guimenu">Context menu</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Blame previous revision</span> generates a blame report for the same file, but using
			the previous revision as the upper limit. This gives you the blame
			report for the state of the file just before the line you are looking
			at was last changed.
			<span class="guimenu">Context menu</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Show changes</span> starts your diff viewer, showing you what changed in
			the referenced revision of the file. Please note, however, that these two options are only available if this line is not there since the initial commit of the file.
			<span class="guimenu">Context menu</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Show log</span> displays the revision log dialog starting with the
			referenced revision.
		</p><p>
			The settings for TortoiseGitBlame can be accessed using
			<span class="guimenu">TortoiseGit</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Settings...</span>
			on the TortoiseGitBlame tab. Refer to
			<a class="xref" href="tgit-dug-settings.html#tgit-dug-settings-tortoiseblame" title="TortoiseGitBlame Settings">the section called “TortoiseGitBlame Settings”</a>.
